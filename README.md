# Tic Tac Toe – IFN563 Assignment 2 🎮

This project is a **console-based Tic Tac Toe game** developed as part of **IFN563 (Advanced Object-Oriented Programming)** at QUT.  
It demonstrates the use of **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles in designing a simple, interactive two-player game.

---

## 📌 Features
- Classic **Tic Tac Toe (3x3 board)** implementation.  
- Two-player mode (human vs human).  
- Input validation to prevent invalid or duplicate moves.  
- Automatic detection of:
  - Player wins (row, column, diagonal).  
  - Draw conditions (full board).  
- Clear, user-friendly console interface.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Language: **C#**  
- Framework: **.NET Console Application**

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/TicTacToe.git

2. Navigate into the project folder:
   cd TicTacToe

3. Build and run:
   dotnet run --project TicTacToe/TicTacToe.csproj


📖 Assignment Context
- This assignment focused on applying:
- Encapsulation: separating game logic into classes and methods.
- Control structures: loops, conditionals, and input handling.
- Object-oriented design to create a modular and reusable program.

It highlights how OOP can be applied even to simple games to ensure readability, maintainability, and scalability.
