# Tic Tac Toe – IFN563 Assignment 2 🎮

This project is a **console-based Tic Tac Toe game** developed as part of **IFN563 (Advanced Object-Oriented Programming)** at QUT.  
It demonstrates the use of **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles in designing a simple, interactive two-player game.

---

## 📌 Features
- Classic **Tic Tac Toe** implementation.  
- Two-player mode (human vs human OR Human vs Computer).  
- Input validation to prevent invalid or duplicate moves.  
- Automatic detection of:

📖 Assignment Context
- This assignment focused on applying:
- Encapsulation: separating game logic into classes and methods.
- Control structures: loops, conditionals, and input handling.
- Object-oriented design to create a modular and reusable program.

It highlights how OOP can be applied even to simple games to ensure readability, maintainability, and scalability.

## 📷 Example Gameplay
- Player 1 (X) - Enter your move: 1 
  
```
1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
